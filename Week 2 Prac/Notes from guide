Add tags to the sections of the websites for CSS
Document will be for the whole page, the header has its own seperate font, it needs to inherit at a differnet stage.
Should work after docment tags in CSS as its read from top to bottom, review how to link google fonts
Images need to sit on left and right 25% each, remaining 50% is for the middle image
Overall the requests are being made to make the text % of the screen size which will need to be reviewed, that won't be px sizing a believe but I think you can add a % to the code to update it

Task is achieveable today.
