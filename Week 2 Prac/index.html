            The Australian Signals Directorate produces the Information Security
            Manual (ISM). The purpose of the ISM is to
            outline a cyber security framework that an organisation can apply,
            using their risk management framework, to
            protect their systems and data from cyber threats. The ISM is
            intended for Chief Information Security Officers,
            Chief Information Officers, cyber security professionals and
            information technology managers.
