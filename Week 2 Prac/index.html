        The Australian Signals Directorate produces the Information Security
        Manual (ISM). The purpose of the ISM is to
        outline a cyber security framework that an organisation can apply,
        using their risk management framework, to
        protect their systems and data from cyber threats. The ISM is
        intended for Chief Information Security Officers,
        Chief Information Officers, cyber security professionals and
        information technology managers.
