    <article class="main">
        <h2>Executive summary</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the <a href="index.html" target="_self">Information Security Manual</a> (ISM) is to outline a
            cyber security framework that an organisation can apply, using their risk management framework, to protect their
            systems and data from cyber threats.</p>

        <h3>Intended audience</h3>
        <p>
            The ISM is intended for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), Chief Information Officers, cyber
            security professionals and information technology managers.
        </p>

        <h3>Authority</h3>
        <p>
            The ISM represents the considered advice of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). This advice is
            provided in accordance with ASDâ€™s designated functions under the 
            <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00928/latest/versions" target="_blank">Services Act 2001</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            ASD also provides cyber security advice in the form of Australian Communications Security Instructions and
            other cyber security-related publications. In these cases, device and application-specific advice may take
            precedence over the advice in the ISM.
        </p>

        <h3>Cyber security principles</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of the cyber security principles within the ISM is to provide strategic guidance on how an
            organisation can protect their systems and data from cyber threats. These cyber security principles are grouped into four
            key activities: govern, protect, detect and respond. An organisation should be able to demonstrate that the
            cyber security principles are being adhered to within their organisation.
        </p>

        <h3>Cyber security guidelines</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of the cyber security guidelines within the ISM is to provide practical guidance on how an
            organisation can protect their systems and data from cyber threats. These cyber security guidelines cover governance,
            physical security, personnel security, and information and communications technology security topics. An organisation
            should consider the cyber security guidelines that are relevant to each of the systems they operate.
        </p>

        <h2>Applying a risk-based approach to cyber security</h2>

        <h3>Using a risk management framework</h3>
        <p>The risk management framework used by the ISM draws from National Institute of Standards and Technology
            (NIST)
            Special Publication (SP) 800-37 Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations:
            A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy. Broadly, the risk management framework used by the ISM
            has six steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>define the system,</li>
            <li>select controls,</li>
            <li>implement controls,</li>
            <li>assess controls,</li>
            <li>authorise the system and monitor the system.</li>
        </ol>
    </article>

    

    <article class="info-grid">
    <div class="Info1"><h3>Define the system</h4>
    <p>
    Determine the type, value and security objectives for the system based on an assessment of the impact if it were
    to be compromised.
    </p></div>

    <div class="Info2"><h3>Select controls</h3>
    <p>Select controls for the system and tailor them to achieve desired security objectives.</p></div>

    <div class="Info3"><h3>Implement controls</h3>
    <p>Implement controls for the system and its operating environment.</p></div>

    <div class="Info4"><h3>Assess controls</h3>
    <p>
    Assess controls for the system and its operating environment to determine if they have been implemented
    correctly and are operating as intended.
    </p></div>

    <div class="Info5"><h3>Authorise the system</h3>
    <p>Authorise the system to operate based on the acceptance of the security risks associated with its operation.</p></div>

    <div class="Info6"><h3>Monitor the system</h3>
    <p>Monitor the system, and associated cyber threats, security risks and controls, on an ongoing basis.</p>
