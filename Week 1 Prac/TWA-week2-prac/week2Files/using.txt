Executive summary
Purpose
The purpose of the LINK[Information Security Manual | index.html | current tab] (ISM) is to outline a cyber security framework that an organisation can apply, using their risk management framework, to protect their systems and data from cyber threats.

Intended audience
The ISM is intended for Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), Chief Information Officers, cyber security professionals and information technology managers.

Authority
The ISM represents the considered advice of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD). This advice is provided in accordance with ASDâ€™s designated functions under the LINK[Intelligence Services Act 2001 | https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A00928/latest/versions | new tab].

ASD also provides cyber security advice in the form of Australian Communications Security Instructions and other cyber security-related publications. In these cases, device and application-specific advice may take precedence over the advice in the ISM.

Cyber security principles
The purpose of the cyber security principles within the ISM is to provide strategic guidance on how an organisation can protect their systems and data from cyber threats. These cyber security principles are grouped into four key activities: govern, protect, detect and respond. An organisation should be able to demonstrate that the cyber security principles are being adhered to within their organisation.

Cyber security guidelines
The purpose of the cyber security guidelines within the ISM is to provide practical guidance on how an organisation can protect their systems and data from cyber threats. These cyber security guidelines cover governance, physical security, personnel security, and information and communications technology security topics. An organisation should consider the cyber security guidelines that are relevant to each of the systems they operate.

Applying a risk-based approach to cyber security
Using a risk management framework
The risk management framework used by the ISM draws from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-37 Rev. 2, Risk Management Framework for Information Systems and Organizations: A System Life Cycle Approach for Security and Privacy. Broadly, the risk management framework used by the ISM has six steps:
define the system,
select controls,
implement controls,
assess controls,
authorise the system and monitor the system.

Define the system
Determine the type, value and security objectives for the system based on an assessment of the impact if it were to be compromised.

Select controls
Select controls for the system and tailor them to achieve desired security objectives.

Implement controls
Implement controls for the system and its operating environment.

Assess controls
Assess controls for the system and its operating environment to determine if they have been implemented correctly and are operating as intended.

Authorise the system
Authorise the system to operate based on the acceptance of the security risks associated with its operation.

Monitor the system
Monitor the system, and associated cyber threats, security risks and controls, on an ongoing basis.

Acknowledgement of Country
We acknowledge the Traditional Owners and Custodians of Country throughout Australia and their continuing connections to land, sea and communities.
We pay our respects to them, their cultures and their Elders; past, present and emerging. We also recognise Australia's First Peoples' enduring contribution to Australia's national security.
